# CU-BDA-2022
## Hello, this is Jessie
* I'm a first year PhD student from the Nolan School of Hotel Administration.
* The first time I heard Bayesian statistics was during my MS in data science and business analytics. I was intrigued by the difference between Bayesian and Frenquentist perspectives and always wanted to know more. Currently I am interested in analyzing hotel online reviews through Natural Language Processing techniques and optimization pricing in travel subscription products. The latter might be more closed to the topic of this class.
