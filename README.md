# CU-BDA-2022
## Hello, this is Jessie
* I'm a first year PhD student from the Nolan School of Hotel Administration.
* The first time I heard Bayesian statistics was during my MS in data science and business analytics. I was intrigued by the difference between Bayesian and Frenquentist perspectives and always wanted to learn more about it. 
* Currently I am interested in 
	* hotel online review analysis through Natural Language Processing techniques, such as summarization and sentiment analysis
	* price optimization in travel subscription products. This topic might be more closely related to the topic of this class.
* The hotel review data looks like this: /images/review_screenshot.png
